</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the biographies of the saints of the early
Celtic Church it is frequently recorded that
towards the close of their lives they left their
monasteries and sought the seclusion of some
lonely island or mountain solitude, in order to
pass the evening of their days in undisturbed devotion
and freedom from worldly cares. Joceline
in his <i>Life of St Kentigern</i> also records that it
was his custom to retire to a cave during Lent,
so that, ‘removed from the strife of tongues and
the tumults of this world, he might hide himself
in God.’ Such retreats, whether they were used
for periodical and temporary seclusion or for
permanent retirement, were called in the ecclesiastical
language of the day <i>Deserta</i>; and the
frequent occurrence of this term in the topography
of Scotland and Ireland—in its modern
form of Dysart or Disert—shows how common
the custom must once have been. Sometimes the
recluse erected a habitation for himself of stones
and turf, as St Cuthbert did in the island of
Farne; but frequently he chose the shelter of
a natural cavern or crevice in the rocks, as St
Cuthbert is also said to have done at Weem in
Perthshire. As the veneration for the memory
of the saint increased with lapse of time, the
sites of such hermitages naturally became places
of pilgrimage, and troops of devotees were drawn
to visit them by rumours of special benefits
accruing to pilgrims of weak health, or peace
of mind procured by the performance of special
vows. In consequence of the peculiar prevalence
of this mode of retirement in the primitive Celtic
Church, cave-hermitages must have been exceedingly
numerous in Scotland. But the thoroughness
of the breach which the Church of the
Reformation made with the traditions and especially
with the superstitious practices of the past,
has obliterated most of the traces of this early
devotion; and it is only in a few isolated and
exceptional cases that any of its associations have
survived to our day.</p>

<p>St Ninian’s Cave, near Physgill, in the parish
of Glasserton, Wigtownshire, is situated a little
to the west of the wooded valley which terminates
in the creek known as Portcastle. It is simply
a triangular fissure in the rock, some ten or
twelve feet wide at the entrance, and about
fifteen feet in height, narrowing inwards until,
at a distance of about twenty-five feet from the
entrance, the sides of the fissure come gradually
together. A rudely-built wall has been constructed
across the mouth of the cave, of which
the lower part still remains. On the occasion of
a visit to the cave by the late Dean Stanley of
Westminster, a small cross was discovered carved
on a projecting part of the rock, and three others
were subsequently made visible by the partial
removal of the debris from the face of the rock.
The form of these crosses is peculiar. They are
equal-limbed crosses, formed by four arcs of
circles intersecting the circumference of a circumscribing
circle. Similar equal-limbed crosses,
but bearing the hook-like curve at the right-hand
corner of the upper limb, which constitutes the
<i>chrisma</i> or monogram—the combined <i>Chi</i> and <i>rho</i>
of the Greek word <i>Christos</i>—are found upon early
Christian monuments at Kirkmadrine and Whithorn
in the same county, but nowhere else in
Scotland. These monuments bear inscriptions
commemorative of certain ‘holy and distinguished
priests’—Viventius, Mavorius, and Florentius.
Their names are so different from those of the
priesthood of the Columban Church, that they
may be regarded as followers if not as contemporaries
of St Ninian. But none of the crosses
in Ninian’s Cave present this peculiarly ancient
characteristic of the <i>chrisma</i>, and these crosses
may therefore be of a much later date than
Ninian’s time. They are not confined to the
rock-face, but have also been carved upon several
of the loose stones found on the floor of the cave.</p>

<p>In the month of June last the cave was
thoroughly explored for the Ayrshire and
Wigtownshire Archæological Association, under
the superintendence of Sir Herbert Maxwell,
M.P., and Mr Cochran-Patrick, M.P., Secretary
of the Association and of the Society of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">{514}</span>
Antiquaries of Scotland. They found that the
whole floor of the cave had been regularly
paved; and close to the entrance, but outside
the external wall which converted the cave
into a chapel, there was a large stone basin
placed under a natural drip from the rock,
which may have served as a holy-water vessel.
A number of additional crosses were also discovered.
On a stone which had been placed
as one of the steps leading down to the paved
floor there were four crosses in a line. On one
of the stones of the pavement was an inscription
in Roman letters, of which the word <span class="smcap">Sancti</span>
could only be deciphered. Underneath the
pavement and throughout the debris of the
cave-floor there was a considerable accumulation
of shells, consisting chiefly of limpets and
periwinkles, mingled with splintered bones, evidently
the refuse of the food of some earlier
occupants. At a considerable depth immediately
outside the wall of the chapel, the decayed
remnants of a human skeleton were disentombed.
Whether these were the bones of a hermit of
the chapel who had chosen to be buried in
the spot where he had ended his solitary life,
or the remains of some victim of violence
placed there for concealment, will probably remain
unknown.</p>

<p>St Ninian, to whom the cave was dedicated,
was the first who preached Christianity among
the southern Picts. His life and labours are
briefly related by the Venerable Bede, and more
fully by Ailred, a Cistercian monk of Rievaux, in
Yorkshire. Ailred, whose <i>Life of St Ninian</i> was
written in the second half of the twelfth century,
states that he derived his materials from a certain
barbarously written manuscript, presumably of
much earlier date. He informs us that Ninian
was born at Whithorn—then called Rosnat—and
that he was the son of a Christian Prince.
Having received his education under the care
of St Martin of Tours, he subsequently went to
Rome, where he remained till he was made a
bishop and sent to evangelise the people of his
native province. From St Martin he obtained
masons to build a stone church in Galloway
after the Roman fashion. As this was the
first stone church erected in Scotland, the fame
of Ninian’s <i>Candida Casa</i> or White House has
been perpetuated in the Saxon form of Whitherne
or Whithorn. The date of its erection is fixed
by the fact that St Martin died in 397 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>;
and St Ninian, having heard of his death while
the church was being built, resolved to dedicate
the finished edifice to his memory. Ninian
himself, after a life full of labours, was buried
in the church of St Martin which he had built;
and Ailred mentions the stone sarcophagus which
contained his remains as still existing in his
day, and much venerated in consequence of the
many miraculous cures said to be wrought upon
those who devoutly frequented it. Pilgrimages
continued to be made to the shrine of St Ninian
down to the period of the Reformation. In a
letter of King James V. of Scotland to the
Pope, the king states that pilgrims from England,
Ireland, the Isles, and adjoining countries
came yearly in flocks to St Ninian’s shrine at
Whithorn. That notable pilgrim King James IV.
made special pilgrimages to this famous shrine,
and his Treasurer has preserved an account of
his disbursements on these occasions. From it
we learn that the king made offerings in money
‘at the Rude Altar; at the fertir (or shrine)
in the outer kirk; at the reliques at the Hie
Altair; at the Lady Altar; and in the chapel
on the hill—at ilk place xiiis. 4d.’ And in
1505 he offered also ‘ane relique of the king’s
awn silver’ of considerable weight and value.</p>

<p>The number of dedications to St Ninian,
scattered over the whole country from the
remotest Northern and Western Isles to the Mull
of Galloway, bear testimony to the widespread
devotion to his memory which once pervaded
the Scottish Church. The removal of a portion
of the wall of the choir of the old church of St
Congan at Turriff in 1861 brought to light a
fresco-painting of St Ninian, robed as a bishop,
with mitre and pastoral staff—the only relic of
pre-Reformation work of the kind that has been
discovered in Scotland. Neither in his <i>Life</i>
nor in any ancient document has any reference
been found to the occupation of the cave at
Physgill by St Ninian; but Sulpicius Severus,
who wrote a Life of St Martin of Tours, mentions
that he had a little cell in the rock at Marmoutier
to which he was accustomed to retire for prayer
and meditation, and that many of his disciples
also dug cells in the rock and took up their abodes
in them. St Ninian being a disciple of St Martin,
there is reason to conclude that in this respect
he would follow the example of his master. But
apart from this consideration, it is certain that
from a very early period this cave has been
traditionally associated with his name, and that
this association was the reason for converting it
into a chapel, where services would be held on
the saint’s anniversaries, pilgrimages performed,
vows paid, and offerings presented. It is not
unlikely that in its earlier days the chapel may
have been ministered to by a resident recluse,
as was often the custom in similar circumstances.
For instance, we are told by Bower, the continuator
of Fordun’s <i>Chronicle</i>, that in crossing
the Firth of Forth in the year 1123, King Alexander
I. was driven by stress of weather to land
on the island of Inchcolm, ‘where at that time
lived an island hermit, who, belonging to the
service of St Columba, devoted himself sedulously
to his duties at a little chapel there, content with
such poor food as the milk of one cow, and the
shells and small sea-fishes he could collect.’ It
is suggestive, too, that one of the copies of the
<i>Scotichronicon</i>—that which belonged to the Abbey
of Coupar-Angus—connects the island of Inchcolm
with St Columba by saying that he lived
in it for a certain time during his ministry
among the Picts and Scots, just as the cave at
Physgill is connected with St Ninian.</p>

<p>There is another cave-chapel on the Wigtownshire
coast, which had a reputation scarcely less
famous than that of St Ninian. St Medan’s Cave,
still locally known as ‘The Chapel Co’,’ is an
irregular rent in the cliff between Maryport and
East Tarbert, about four miles from Drumore.
In front of it are the remains of a wall about
four feet thick, of rough stones and lime, still
showing traces of the doorway, and one deeply
splayed window. About twelve feet farther in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">{515}</span>
is the back wall of the chapel, reaching to the
roof of the cave, but giving access, by a square-headed
doorway four feet high and two and a half
feet wide, to the small natural cell in which the
cave terminates. Near the external entrance there
are three pools or rock basins, within the tide-mark,
and usually full of sea-water. The largest,
which is about four feet in diameter, is known
as ‘the Body Pool,’ and was used for the cure of
internal and wasting disorders, being specially
efficacious in cases of ‘back-gane bairns’. The
second pool, of an irregularly triangular shape,
and about two feet long, was known as ‘the
Knee Pool,’ and was considered effectual for the
cure of diseases of the lower limbs. The third
pool, a circular basin about six inches diameter
and the same in depth, was used for sore eyes.
The cave and its pools were largely frequented
for curative purposes down almost to the commencement
of the present century, and continued
to be occasionally visited to a much later
period. There are persons yet living who
remember large gatherings at St Medan’s Chapel,
especially on the first Sunday of May, old style.
St Medan, who is commemorated in the dedication
of the church of Kirkmaiden, was one of the
‘devout women’ of the early Celtic Church of
whom there is no distinct biographic record.
The <i>Breviary of Aberdeen</i> states that she came
from Ireland to Galloway, and ended her days
near the blessed St Ninian. Mr Skene identifies
her with Modwena, whose original name was
Darerca, a convert of St Patrick, who died on
St Columba’s birthday, July 6, 519 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>St Kieran’s Cave is situated in the precipitous
cliffs of Achinhoan Head, about three miles
south of the site of the church dedicated to him
at Kilkerran, in Kintyre, Argyllshire. It is one
of many fissures occurring in the limestone rock
on this coast, irregularly triangular in shape,
spacious and lofty. A substantially built wall
three feet thick has been constructed across the
entrance. Immediately within the entrance is
a rough boulder with an oval basin scooped
in its upper surface, which is placed beneath
a drip of water from the roof of the cave,
and thus forms a reservoir, which may have
answered the purposes of a hermit’s well, a
holy-water vessel for the pilgrims’ chapel, and
a curative or holy well for the superstitious uses
of later times. Close by it is another boulder
about two feet in diameter, the upper surface of
which is prettily carved with a circular border
of fretwork, such as is frequently seen on the
early sculptured monuments of Scotland and
Ireland, inclosing a hexafoil with its points connected
by arcs of circles. A writer in the old
<i>Statistical Account of Scotland</i> also speaks of
the cross which St Kieran had cut upon the
rock; but this is no longer visible. Kieran
Macantsaor, or the ‘carpenter’s son,’ was Abbot
of Clonmacnois. In his youth he was a disciple
of St Finan of Clonard; and in proof of the
sanctity of his life, it is told of him that ‘he
never looked upon a woman, and never told a
lie.’ He was held in great esteem by St Columba,
who is said to have written a hymn in praise of
Kieran. He died at the age of thirty-three,
and ‘was likened to Christ, both on account of
his age and that his father was a carpenter like
Joseph Muire.’</p>

<p>A cave on the western shore of Loch Caolisport,
also in Argyllshire, is associated with the
name of the great evangelist of Scotland, St
Columba. Like most other cave-chapels, it has
the remains of a wall, with a doorway, constructed
across the entrance. On a kind of rocky
shelf close by the doorway is a rude circular
basin, which probably served as the holy-water
vessel of the chapel. Against the rock forming
the east side of the cave is the altar platform,
roughly but solidly built, and still standing—or
at least till quite recently—to nearly its full
height. On the smooth face of the rock above
the centre of the altar platform is a cross carved
in relief, of the Latin form, but with its arms
and summit slightly expanding towards the
extremities. This cross is placed a little to one
side of the centre; but more nearly in a central
position over the altar there are discernible the
almost obliterated outlines of a much older cross
which has been incised in the rock. At a little
distance from the cave are the ruins of an
ancient chapel dedicated to St Columba. It is
a small plain edifice about forty feet by twenty-two,
with one east window, and the remains of
a window in each of the side-walls near the
eastern end. The tradition is that St Columba,
landing here on his way to Iona, established the
chapel in the cave, which was ever afterwards
held sacred to his memory, and that the chapel
near it was subsequently founded in his honour.
The cave was cleared out about two years ago
by the proprietor; but no record of what might
have been a most interesting scientific investigation
appears to have been preserved. It is said
that a great many burials were found in the
floor of the cave—as many as sixteen or eighteen
different skeletons are supposed to have been
found—and underneath them the traces of a
more ancient occupation of the cavern, probably
in pagan times.</p>

<p>The cave of St Molio in the Island of Lamlash, or
Holy Island, on the east side of Arran, is a natural
cavity in the sandstone rock, about twenty-five
feet above the present tide-mark. Traces of a
rudely-built wall across its entrance are still
visible. A shelf of rock within the cave is
known as ‘the Saint’s Bed;’ a large flat-topped
rock close by with several step-like recesses cut
in its circumference is called ‘the Saint’s Chair;’
and a fine spring of pure water, which is known
as ‘the Saint’s Well,’ was formerly much resorted
to for the healing virtues of its water. The
Island of Lamlash appears in ancient documents
as Helant-in-laysche or Almeslach, and this form
of the name identifies it with St Molaissi or
Laisren of Leighlin, a nephew of St Blane of
Kingarth in Bute. His mother was a daughter
of Aedhan, king of the Scots of Dalriada; and
it is told of him, that in order to avoid being
made king, he retired to an island in the sea
between Alban and Britain—between the country
of the Scots and that of the Britons of Strathclyde.
This answers precisely to the situation of the
Holy Island which is still associated with his
name. There was a relic either of St Molaissi
or of St Moluag of Lismore preserved in Arran
down to the time of Martin’s visit to the island
in the beginning of the last century. This was
the <i>Baul Muluy</i>, a ‘green stone, like a globe in
figure, about the bigness of a goose-egg,’ which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">{516}</span>
was much used by the islanders for curing diseases
and ‘for swearing decisive oaths upon it.’ It
seems to have been in the hereditary custody
of a family of Mackintoshes, and had also the
reputation of having been anciently a <i>vexillum</i>
or battle-ensign of the Macdonalds of the Isles,
carried with their host in their conflicts, in the
belief that its presence would secure to them
victory over their enemies. The cave of St
Molio has several Runic inscriptions cut upon
its interior—mere <i>graffiti</i> of occasional visitors
at the time when the galleys of the Northmen
frequented the western seas. Amudar, Ontur,
and Sea-elk, who have left their names there,
may have been pagans; but Nicolas of Haen, who
carved the longest inscription, bears a good Christian
name.</p>

<p>St Serf’s Cave at Dysart, in Fife, derived its
sanctity—as the town of Dysart has derived its
name—from its having been the <i>desertum</i> or place
of retirement of the saint during his seasons of
meditation and prayer. The <i>Aberdeen Breviary</i>
states that ‘once upon a time the devil tempted
the blessed St Serf with divers questions in the
cave at Dysart; but confounded by the divine
virtue, he went away; and from that day the
said demon has appeared to no one in that cave,
although the place is still held famous in honour
of St Serf.’ Andrew of Wyntoun, prior of St
Serf’s monastery in Lochleven, as in duty bound,
gives, in his <i>Cronykill of Scotland</i>, a circumstantial
account of this disputation with the Evil One:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Quhill Saynt Serf in till a stede</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay eftir Maytynis in hys bede,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The devil came in full intent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For til fand him with argument;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>proposing to the saint many of the questions
of high theological speculation which presented
themselves to the cultivated minds of the fifteenth
century, and receiving orthodox, and consequently
unanswerable replies to them all:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thane sawe the devil that he coud nocht,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all the wylis that he socht,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ourecum Saynt Serf; he sayd than</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He kend hym for a wys man;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the saint becoming impatient of his flattery,
commanded him to begone from his cave, and
never more to annoy any one in it. This
prohibition apparently obtained for the cave a
reputation as of a place for ever freed from the
temptations of the Evil One, and it continued in
consequence to be used as a chapel, and largely
frequented by pilgrims down almost to the
Reformation.</p>

<p>St Adrian’s Cave at Caiplie, also on the north
shore of the Firth of Forth, consists of a cluster
of contiguous cavities formed by the sea washing
out the softer parts of the rock. The principal
cavity bears obvious marks of artificial adaptation.
It is somewhat irregular in shape, but large
and lofty; and the foundation courses of a wall
constructed across its entrance are still visible.
Near the mouth of the cave, a kind of platform
or seat is shaped in the rock, and a door cut
through the rock communicates with a smaller
cell on the south side. On the west side, a series
of steps led up to a smaller cell, in the inner
part of which was a kind of bench cut in the
rock, which is said to have been the hermit’s
bed. In front of the cave, five human skeletons
were found, four of which were regularly buried
east and west, the heads to the west, but without
coffins. A considerable quantity of bones of oxen,
sheep, and swine, and portions of deer-horns,
were found mixed with the debris in front of
the cave, evidently the refuse of the food of its
occupants at some remote period. On the interior
of the rocky walls of the cave, many pilgrim
crosses are carved, some of the equal-armed form
and surrounded with a border, but mostly of
the Latin form. St Adrian, whose true name
was probably Odran, is represented as having
settled and laboured among the Pictish people
of the east parts of Scotland. His settlement
in the Firth of Forth is thus described by
Wyntoun:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">In steddis sere the Wattyr off Forth.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Pittenweem, St Monance, and other places
along the coast as far as Fifeness, there are
several caves which have pilgrim crosses and
other symbols of archaic character carved upon
their rocky walls. All of these seem at one
time to have been occupied as places of retreat
and devotion by saints or recluses of the early
Celtic Church, and doubtless are the <i>steddis
sere</i> (that is, the ‘several places’) referred to in
Wyntoun’s narrative. At Fifeness is the cave
of Constantine, king of the Scots, who, after a
reign of forty years, exchanged the sceptre for
the pilgrim’s staff, and ‘died in the house of
the Apostle;’ that is, of St Andrew. At St
Andrews itself is the cave of St Rule, or rather
what remains of it, for it has been much
destroyed within the last half-century. Sir Walter
Scott describes the palmer in <i>Marmion</i> as bound
to fair St Andrews:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Within the ocean cave to pray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where good St Rule his holy lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From midnight to the dawn of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sang to the billows’ sound;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and mentions that on one side of the cave there
still remained a sort of stone altar. The <i>Aberdeen
Breviary</i> states that St Gernadius, who settled
at Kennedor, in Moray, lived in a cell partly
natural, but artificially adapted for a habitation,
in which he was wont to repose his wearied
limbs on a bed of stone. His cave in the
neighbourhood of Lossiemouth is distinguished
by the holy well close beside it, which had a
local reputation until quite recently, and is still
known as St Gerardine’s Well. St Baldred of
the Bass, who sat upon the rock in Aldhame
Bay, and caused it to transport itself out of
the fairway, had his cave also in the cliff
opposite this rock; and traces have been found
both upon the rock itself and in the cave
of a long-continued occupation at a remote
period.</p>

<p>Although the materials for the illustration of
this long-forgotten phase of ecclesiastical life are
so few and fragmentary, they suffice to reveal
the presence in these early ages of a passionate
fervour of devotion and a child-like simplicity
of faith to which we are altogether strangers in
these times. The systems and institutions by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">{517}</span>
which they were created and fostered ‘are productions
of old ages, not to be repeated in the
new: they presuppose a certain rudeness of
conception, which the progress of mere scientific
knowledge puts an end to.’</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.—A LAND SHIPWRECK.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> be unhappy and alone at night in chambers
is to have an opportunity of realising the sense
of desolation in its bitterest degree. The double
doors and double windows which secure the
stillness that is of so much importance for
working purposes, seem now to shut you off
doubly from the world; from help if you are
dying, and from sympathy if you live. The
rumble of the heaviest wagon reaches the ears
as a faint sound from afar off; no footstep is
heard at all; and the adjacent chambers are
silent as the tenements of the dead. You
welcome the plash of rain against the window-panes—dull
as that is—as if it were a friend
come to speak to you in your solitude.</p>

<p>That is the time for thoughts of suicide to
haunt a man if his mind is disturbed; and that
is the time for cynical broodings on the vanity
of life, the falsehood of friendship, and the
fickleness of love. He sees in what miserable
failure his most earnest efforts have resulted;
he misinterprets the most trivial word and look
of his friend, and he loses grip altogether of
that faith which in healthier state enables
him to find consolation in love. He recalls
all the bitter things that have been written
about women, and for the time-being believes
them.</p>

<p>How was it, Philip asked himself, that he
had fallen into this desperate position? He
had laboured with all his might for others
rather than for himself; his object was a noble
one, and quite feasible, he was still convinced.
Yet the social revolution he had dreamed of
was as far off as ever, and he suddenly found
that he was face to face with absolute ruin.
Evidently his blunder lay in his miscalculation
of the power of his capital. There had been
disappointments with his fellow-workers, who,
shrewdly counting the cost of material and the
market value of the manufactured article, saw
that the latter would barely realise enough to
give them a fair ordinary wage in the best of
times, to say nothing of the share of profits
promised them. The cost of material was too
high; and it was natural that they should conclude
the cost was so fixed by arrangement with
their chief in order to deprive them of what
they now called their rights.</p>

<p>Philip saw the force of their argument, and
began to inquire about the items of expenditure.
Hitherto, he had been so deeply occupied in
the organisation of his scheme, that he had left
financial matters almost entirely in Wrentham’s
hands. Hints were given him that the prices
he was charged were not the prices paid for
materials, but that a large proportion went in
secret commissions. As soon as he began to
look into the question closely, he was met by
the astounding fact, that he had reached the
end of his capital, and had heavy liabilities
to meet almost immediately, as well as heavy
current expenses to provide for. How to do
this without applying to Mr Shield, he had
been trying for weeks to find out; and the
more harassed he became, the more impossible
it appeared to work through the mess without
assistance.</p>

<p>Then had come the last humiliation: he must
submit to the immediate and entire overthrow
of all he had been working for, and in which
he had sunk the considerable fortune placed at
his disposal, or he must seek the help which
only a short time ago had appeared to him as
an impossible necessity. He was bewildered, and
could not understand how it came about. It
should not have been so. He yielded to the
necessity, however; but determined that when
his course became clear again, his first task
should be to institute a thorough investigation
into the causes of his failure.</p>

<p>Through all this agitated survey of his position,
how was it that the figure of Beecham continually
obtruded itself? What could Wrentham
have had in his head, when he urged him so
strongly to find out from Madge all that she
knew of the man’s history and possible friendship
with Mr Shield? He had not felt very keenly
impressed by the suggestion during Wrentham’s
presence; but now, in the silence and alone with
his chagrin, he became infected with Wrentham’s
suspicion. It had not occurred to him until
now that there was something most incongruous
and altogether incomprehensible in a girl consenting
to accept from an acquaintance of only
a few weeks a confidence which she could not
disclose to her guardians or the man who was
soon to be her husband.</p>

<p>If Beecham had been a younger man than
he was, there would have been a ready and
most bitter explanation of the mystery; but it
was not available in the present case. And yet
(so outrageously morbid had he become that he
was capable of the thought!) women were such
strange creatures, that there was no telling who
might win their favour or by what charm it
might be done.</p>

<p>Pah!—What madness was this?</p>

<p>He went to the front room and opened a
window overlooking Gray’s Inn Road. The
stillness of the chambers had become intolerable.
This was better; much better. There was more
air; he could hear the rattle of cabs, and catch
glimpses of hurrying foot-passengers on the
opposite side of the way.</p>

<p>Why should he remain indoors, to be haunted
by these horrible phantoms of doubt and suspicion?
He knew they were phantoms, and yet
he could not drive them from his brain. Sleep
was impossible, and he was afraid to take more
drugs, for he was conscious that they had already
impaired his power of self-control. When would
the morning come? The active duties he had
to discharge would relieve him. He looked at
his watch. Very little past midnight. Why, it
seemed as if two nights had passed since
Wrentham went away!</p>

<p>Well, he would try Dr Joy’s specific, and
endeavour to work, or walk off this nervous
frenzy. First he tried the work. There was
much need that he should master the accounts
and compare prices paid with prices quoted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">{518}</span>
the markets. But the figures performed such
strange antics before his eyes, that after an hour
of vain endeavour to master their meaning, he
impatiently closed the book and rose no wiser,
or rather less wise, than he had been before he
sat down.</p>

<p>He took himself to task. It was of the utmost
importance that in the morning he should be
cool and clear-headed; but he could not hope
to be so unless he obtained sleep. Well, he
would try the second remedy.</p>

<p>He put on his hat and overcoat and went
out. It was not of any consequence to him in
which direction he should walk, his sole object
being to exhaust himself by the physical exercise,
in order to induce healthy sleep. To distract
his mind from its troublous ruminations, he
turned instinctively towards those quarters where
he was most likely to encounter signs of life.</p>

<p>He strode along Oxford Street and down
Regent Street. But he was walking in a dream.
The lights of the lamps were dim in his eyes,
the figures which flitted by him were like
shadows, and he could not have told whether
they were men or women. The voices of those
who passed him seemed to be muffled, and he
scarcely distinguished any sounds. A hansom
cab came rattling at full speed towards him: the
horse slipped, staggered, fell. There was a commotion,
and although, a minute before, the street
seemed to be deserted, figures sprang out of the
darkness, and there was a crowd at the scene of
disaster.</p>

<p>He passed on, with that insensibility to the
fate of others which characterises people when
in dreamland. His feelings were numbed as his
eyes were dimmed. The sense of humiliation at
the utter failure of what he had believed to be
so certain of success produced the one pain of
which he was conscious, and which no drugs,
fatigue, or reason had power to subdue.</p>

<p>If the money had been his own, he could
have borne with comparative calmness the overthrow
of his hopes and the ridicule of those who
had from the first called his project folly.</p>

<p>But despite the assurances of Mr Shield and
of Mr Shield’s solicitors, Philip had never
regarded the money otherwise than as held in
trust; and the loss of it was as bitter as the
destruction of the beautiful palace he had built
in air.</p>

<p>The only bit of ballast left him was the
dogged conviction that the principle which he had
endeavoured to carry into practical effect was a
right one, and would be turned to good account
by some one more fortunate or more careful
than he had been.</p>

<p>He set his teeth together and marched on.
He began to realise how strangely numbed his
sensations were, and how vague everything
appeared to him. The rain had ceased, and the
tiny pools in the roadway glistening in the
lamplight seemed like great white eyes staring
at him in pity. He passed down the Haymarket,
nor did he slacken his pace until he reached
the Embankment. There he halted and leaned
over the parapet. He was not fatigued: the
rapid walk seemed to have instilled new strength
into him and had partially cleared the cobwebs
from his brain. He was attracted by the lights
gleaming in the dark fast-flowing river. Out
there, were black islets of barges, and on the
opposite shore the fantastic outlines of buildings,
showing like irregular ramparts against the dull
gray sky. He was thinking of Madge, and the
pain she would suffer on his account, when the
worst was made known to her in the morning,
perhaps, or next day.</p>

<p>‘Got a copper to spare a poor cove as hasn’t
had a crust for two days?’ said a husky voice
close to him.</p>

<p>Philip started up. He was aware of the evil
reputation of the Embankment and the character
of the roughs who infest it after nightfall. A
lamp close by showed him a miserable-looking
wretch, ragged and hungry-eyed. He did seem
to need help, poor fellow. Philip gave him a
shilling, and was about to pass on. But a huge
hulk of a fellow stood in his way.</p>

<p>‘We want som’at more nor that, guv’nor.
So tip us’——</p>

<p>The man went down as if he had been shot.
Philip was in the mood for mischief, and he had
not forgotten his practice with the gloves. So
the first words of the ruffian plainly intimating
his purpose, a well-delivered blow straight from
the shoulder finished the sentence for him.
Philip knew that it would have been madness
to have given the man time to attack him,
and as it was, the other man was already
attempting to rifle his pockets. This one belonged
to the sneak tribe, and finding his throat
suddenly gripped by fingers that seemed to possess
the strength of a vice, his hands went up to
loosen them. He was hurled aside; and Philip
hurried away with a sort of savage pleasure in
having punished the brace of scoundrels, as well
as disappointed them of their expected prize.</p>

<p>Near Blackfriars Bridge he met a policeman,
to whom he briefly reported the incident. The
man listened with stolid indifference.</p>

<p>‘They are a bad lot about here, at nights,
sir,’ he said composedly; ‘and it ain’t a place
for decent people at this hour.’</p>

<p>The constable’s idea evidently was that decent
people should keep out of the way of the roughs,
not that it was his duty to keep the roughs
from molesting the decent people who might
be compelled to use the thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Philip entered his dreary chambers again.
He felt better, but still he could not sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LONDON_HOSPITALS_AND">LONDON HOSPITALS AND
DISPENSARIES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the day when Rahere the troubador, in the
year 1123 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, founded the hospital of St Bartholomew,
the number of hospitals, dispensaries,
infirmaries, and other institutions for the cure
and medical treatment of the sick poor, has gone
on increasing, till now it stands at considerably
over one hundred and fifty for London and
its district alone. This is altogether exclusive
of the workhouse infirmaries. Besides hospitals
and dispensaries, there are included in the above
number institutions for the supply of surgical
instruments, &amp;c., either free, or at such reduced
prices as bring them within the reach even of the
very poor. Twelve of the London hospitals have
medical schools attached to them, amongst which
is one for the education of lady-doctors. Differences
of opinion of course exist as to the medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">{519}</span>
woman, some no doubt regarding her as a great
acquisition, and one of the glories of the nineteenth
century; whilst others would speak of her as an
institution naturally to be expected in the dark
ages, but quite an anomaly in a civilised age.
Which of the views may be the correct one, we
will not pretend to say. However this may be,
in Henrietta Street stands the medical school
for women, which is in connection with the Royal
Free Hospital, Gray’s Inn Road.</p>

<p>The hospitals with medical schools attached
undertake the treatment of almost every form
of disease both surgical and medical. Still, there
are some diseases which it is necessary should
be treated apart in special hospitals, and the chief
of these is that terrible scourge of past times,
smallpox. Not only smallpox but scarlet fever
and other infectious diseases have to be excluded
from some of the hospitals of which we are speaking,
inasmuch as they are not all provided with
wards set apart for infectious cases. To get an
idea, however, of the great variety of work undertaken
by the largest hospitals, it may be well to
glance at the various departments of medicine and
surgery represented at St Bartholomew’s Hospital,
the oldest of these London institutions. In addition
to the out-patients’ rooms, and wards devoted
to the treatment of ordinary medical and surgical
diseases and accidents, there are the following
special departments: A department for skin
diseases; for diseases of the eye, ear, and throat;
an orthopædic department; a dental department;
a department for the special diseases of women;
a maternity department; and lastly, in the case
of this hospital, a ward for the treatment of
cases of infectious disease. The average number
of in-patients is estimated at over six thousand
annually, and the out-patients at more than one
hundred and fifty thousand. It will readily be
believed that the work of the physicians and surgeons,
both visiting and resident, connected with
such an institution is by no means light. There
are many other general hospitals in various parts
of London, besides those having medical schools
attached to them, but we cannot speak of them
here. The nature of their work is much the
same as that of the others, though of course the
extent of it is more limited.</p>

<p>Coming next to the dispensaries—their name
is legion. Almost every parish in London has one
or more, and they are very abundant in the immediate
suburbs also. Some of these dispensaries
are free, others are to a greater or less extent
self-supporting. It is, we hope, needless to say
that the public dispensaries of which we are
speaking are not to be confounded with the
private dispensaries set up by medical men, quite
legitimately, for their own benefit, but which are
not unfrequently conducted upon the lowest of
commercial principles. The public dispensaries
of London, with their committees of management
and staffs of physicians and surgeons—who in the
case of the free dispensaries are almost invariably
honorary—do excellent work, and are worthy of
all, and more than all, the support which they
obtain. Unlike the majority of hospitals, they
undertake the treatment of disease at the patients’
own homes; and by calling in the aid of the
nursing institutions, they are able to supply not
only medical attendance and medicine, but also
trained nurses. Recently, an effort has been
made to increase the number of provident dispensaries;
and this indeed appears to be one of
the best ways of meeting the difficulty of supplying
good medical treatment to the poor cheaply,
without demanding of medical men more unpaid
work. It has been estimated that the medical
profession does more work without payment than
the rest of the professions put together.</p>

<p>We will now say a few words concerning the
special hospitals and dispensaries. And first, it
is to be remembered that all are not of the same
merit. Many of them may be said to be above
praise; but some, it is to be feared, are almost
beneath contempt. Indeed, the opinion of those
in the medical profession best able to judge of
the matter is, we believe, strongly opposed to
the multiplication of special hospitals, except of
course for those diseases which cannot be advantageously
treated in the general hospitals. Enumerating
now the special hospitals and dispensaries
in their alphabetical order, first of all come
those for the treatment of cancer, of which there
are two. Then there are eight hospitals for children.
A visit to the hospital in Great Ormond
Street is calculated to make most persons enthusiastic
on the subject of well-managed children’s
hospitals; and many readers will remember the
glowing description given by Charles Dickens of
the East London Hospital for Children. Of
hospitals for diseases of the chest there are five.
The physicians of the general hospitals do not,
if they can avoid it, admit patients suffering from
consumption. The air of a hospital in which
wounds and diseases of almost every kind are
being treated is ill fitted to give any good chance
of recovery to a case of consumption, which
requires almost more than anything else fresh
air and plenty of it; and if such a patient gets
no good, he only occupies uselessly the place of
some one who might benefit greatly by admission.
Chest diseases require, too, arrangements for the
securing of appropriate temperature, and this it
would not be easy to do in a general hospital.
It is well, therefore, that there should be special
hospitals for diseases of the chest, and it is to be
regretted the number is at present quite insufficient.
Still, these chest hospitals contrive to
treat a very large number of patients in the
course of the year, the average being estimated
at considerably over thirty-two thousand.</p>

<p>There are six hospitals and infirmaries for the
throat and ear; and three for diseases of the
nervous system. Next we come to the fever
hospitals—four in number. It is almost impossible
to overrate the value of these hospitals.
They not only tend to prevent the occurrence
of epidemics, by removing the fever-stricken
from the healthy, but they also save many from
the untimely death that might have befallen
them in their own ill-ventilated homes, and with
the intermittent nursing which alone they could
have secured. And further; even when the
danger of death is past, the continuous care
which can be given to patients in a hospital may
restore many more to sound health, who in their
own homes would only have escaped death to
remain for the rest of their days miserable
invalids.</p>

<p>The hospitals to be next mentioned are one
for fistula and one for diseases of the hip. Then
there are three buildings for the reception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">{520}</span>
cases of incurable disease; two hospitals for
lunatics; six lying-in hospitals; six for diseases
of the eye; three orthopædic hospitals; one
specially for accidents; six for skin diseases;
four for smallpox—to which the remarks made
on the fever hospitals of course apply; one for
stone; three for women; and four for women and
children.</p>

<p>We have said nothing concerning the convalescent
hospitals. Most of them are of course
situated in the country; but those anywhere near
London are largely supplied with patients from
the metropolis. Their value is immense, for they
restore many patients to complete health, who,
had they gone back to their work immediately
after severe illness, and the bad hygienic conditions
pertaining to their homes, might have
sunk into a state of permanent ill-health.</p>

<p>There are a few other hospitals which may
be alluded to, for, though they are not special
as regards the diseases treated in them, yet
they are special in other ways. Thus, there is
the hospital at Greenwich for seamen; the French
hospital for all foreigners who speak the French
language; and the German hospital ‘for natives
of Germany, others speaking the German language
and English, in cases of accident;’ and lastly,
there are a temperance hospital, a medical
mission hospital, and one medical mission
dispensary.</p>

<p>And now it might perhaps seem that London
has hospitals enough; but those who have had
some experience of the matter are not wont to say
so. They freely admit that numbers of persons
seek and obtain the help of hospitals who have
from their circumstances no right to it, and these
they would gladly see excluded; but they cannot
admit that even then there would be hospital
accommodation enough for the legitimate claimants.
Nay, they may go further, and declare
that there is, through the length and breadth
of that ‘great province of houses’ which men
call London, an urgent and increasing demand
for more. An attempt to meet this demand so
far was made a few years ago, when Pay-hospitals
were opened in Fitzroy Square and elsewhere
(as described in this <i>Journal</i> for October
13, 1880). This class of institutions might well
be extended, as there are many patients both
able and willing to pay for the treatment they
require; and the still further development of
such hospitals would greatly relieve the pressure
presently felt by the purely charitable
institutions.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IN_A_FLASH">IN A FLASH.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> first I remember my aunt Barbara, she
was over forty years of age; but she could never
have been accounted a handsome woman. She
was very tall and very angular, with a long
thin face, the most remarkable feature of which
was a Roman nose of commanding proportions.
But as she had one of the kindest hearts in the
world, her paucity of good looks seemed a
matter of trifling moment to those who had
the privilege of knowing her well. It was at
my request that, some two or three years before
her death, she wrote out the following narrative
of an actual occurrence in her early life. I put
the manuscript away at the time, and did not
come across it again till the other day. On
looking over it once more, it seemed to me not
unworthy of being transcribed for a wider circle
of readers than that comprised by the writer’s
immediate friends and acquaintances.</p>


<p class="p2">You ask me to go back in memory (begins
my aunt) to what seems to me now like a period
of remote antiquity, when I, Barbara Waldron,
was twenty-four years of age, and my sister
Bessie five years younger, and endeavour to put
down in writing the little story I told you by
word of mouth a few days ago.</p>

<p>You must know, then, that in those far-off
days, my sister and I were keeping house for
our brother John, who at that time filled the
position of steward and land-agent to Lord
Dorrington. The house we lived in was a
pleasant but somewhat lonely residence, about
half a mile from the little country town of
Levensfield. The house suited us for several
reasons. In the first place, the rent was low;
in the next, a large walled garden was
attached to it, in which Bessie and I spent
many happy hours; and in the third place,
there was a side-entrance to Dorrington Park,
by which my brother could take a short-cut
to the Hall whenever he had business with
his lordship, or his lordship had business with
him. Our household was a small one, and
besides ourselves, comprised only Mary Gibbs,
a middle-aged woman, and her niece, a girl of
sixteen. John’s horse and gig were looked after
by a young man named Reuben Gates, who
did not, however, sleep on the premises. An
important part of John’s duties was to receive
and pay into the Levensfield bank the rents
due from the farmers and other tenants of
property held under Lord Dorrington. One such
tenant was a certain Mr Shillito, a corn and
seed merchant, who was noted for his eccentricities.
It was only in keeping with Mr Shillito’s
aggravating way of doing business that he should
never pay his rent at the time other people
paid theirs; that he should always pay it in
gold and notes, instead of giving a cheque for
the amount, as he was quite in a position to
have done; and that he should make a point
of bringing it himself, instead of naming a
time when my brother might have called upon
him; and finally, that he seldom arrived with
the money till after banking-hours.</p>

<p>We come now to a certain autumn evening.
Kitty had just brought in the tea-tray. It was
growing dusk, almost too dusk to see clearly
without the lamp; but Bessie and I liked to
economise the daylight as much as possible,
especially now that the long winter nights were
so close upon us. John had come in for a cup
of tea. This evening, he was going to drive
over to Nethercroft, some ten miles away, dine
there with some friends, and stay all night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">{521}</span>
After dinner, there was to be a dance; and I
was not without my suspicions as to the nature
of the attraction which was taking him so far
from home, although he laughingly pooh-poohed
the soft impeachment, when I challenged him
with it. John was in the act of putting down
his cup and saucer, when we heard a noise of
wheels outside, which presently came to a stand
opposite the house. He crossed the room and
peered through the window.</p>

<p>‘It’s old Shillito, come to pay his rent,’ he
remarked a moment later. ‘Two hours after
banking-time, as usual. What a nuisance he
is!’ He went down-stairs; and about ten
minutes later we heard Mr Shillito’s trap start
off. Presently John came back. ‘Ninety pounds,
all in gold and notes,’ he said. ‘I’ve had to
lock it up in my desk till morning.’</p>

<p>I may here remark that iron safes for the
custody of money and other valuables were by
no means so common in those days, especially
in out-of-the-way country-places, as they appear
to have since become.</p>

<p>‘But the money will be quite safe in your
desk, won’t it, John?’ asked Bessie.</p>

<p>‘Safe enough without a doubt, seeing that
no one but ourselves knows of its presence
there. Only, as a matter of business, I should
prefer to have had it in the coffers of the bank.’
Presently he added: ‘The old fellow was half-seas
over, as he generally is; and I have no
doubt, with so many houses of call by the
way, that he will be soaked through and
through before he reaches home. I wonder
whether he goes to bed sober a night in his
life?’</p>

<p>A few minutes later, John kissed us and bade
us good-night. Bessie and I went to the window
to see him start; but by this time it was nearly
dark. He waved his whip at us as soon as he
had settled himself in his seat, then he gave
the reins a little shake. Black Beryl’s heels
struck fire from the stones as she sprang
forward, the gravel scrunched beneath the
wheels, and a moment later the shadows of
evening had swallowed up horse and gig and
driver. My sister and I pulled down the blinds
and drew the curtains and rang for Kitty to
bring in the lamp.</p>

<p>The evening passed after our usual quiet
fashion. We worked a little and read a little
and played some half-dozen duets, and chatted
between times, till the clock pointed to half-past
ten, at which hour we generally retired for the
night. My last duty every evening was to go the
round of the house and satisfy myself that all
lights were out, that the fires were safe, and that
all the doors and windows were properly secured.
When this duty had been duly accomplished
to-night, the drawing-room lamp was extinguished,
and then Bessie and I took our bed
candles and marched up-stairs, leaving darkness
and solitude behind us. Mary Gibbs and Kitty
had retired long ago.</p>

<p>My sister’s room and mine adjoined each other,
with a door of communication between, which
generally stood partly open at night, for the
sake of companionship. The windows of both
rooms looked into the garden, which ran in a
wide strip along that side of the house, and was
shut in by a wall some seven or eight feet high,
beyond which were three or four meadows, and
then the boundary-wall of Dorrington Park.</p>

<p>It was close on one o’clock—as I found out
afterwards—when I woke suddenly from a sound
sleep. The instant I opened my eyes the room
was illumined by a vivid flash of lightning,
and in all probability it was a peal of thunder
that had broken my slumbers. Another flash
followed after a brief interval, succeeded again
by the deafening accompaniment. My sleep was
effectually broken. I arose, flung a shawl over
my shoulders, and crossing to the window,
drew back the blind and peered out. As long
ago as I can remember, lightning has always
had a singular fascination for me. As a child,
I loved to gaze upon its vivid splendours, and
in this respect at least years have left me
unchanged. A board creaked as I crossed the
floor.</p>

<p>‘Is that you, Barbara?’ asked my sister from
the other room.</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear. I am going to look out for a
few minutes. Is not the lightning beautiful?’</p>

<p>‘Very beautiful; only I wish it were anywhere
rather than here,’ answered Bessie, who
at such times was just as nervous as I was
the reverse.</p>

<p>The flashes followed each other at intervals
of about a minute. I had witnessed three or
four when suddenly I gave a start, and an
exclamation broke involuntarily from my lips.
The last flash had revealed to me the figures
of two men in the act of climbing over the
garden-wall. One of the men was a stranger
to me; but in the other, instantaneous as
was the revelation, I recognised the somewhat
peculiar face and figure of a man named Dethel,
whom my brother had employed temporarily
during the last week or two in the garden, our
regular man being laid up at the time with
rheumatism. There was something in the looks
of the man in question which had set me against
him from the first; but if we were all to be
judged by our looks alone, what would become
of us! For aught I knew to the contrary,
Dethel might be an honest, hard-working fellow,
with a wife and children dependent on him;
but for all that, on the days he was working
for us I carefully refrained from going into the
garden.</p>

<p>And now, here was this man, and another
with him, effecting a surreptitious entry of the
premises at one o’clock in the morning! Such
a proceeding could have but one end in view.
Two questions at once put themselves to me.
Firstly, were these men aware that my brother
was from home for the night, and that only
three helpless women and a girl were left in
the house? Secondly, had they by some means
become cognisant of the fact that a few hours
previously Mr Shillito had paid my brother a
considerable sum of money, which must necessarily
still be somewhere on the premises? In
my mind there was little doubt that both these
facts were fully known to the men. My brother’s
movements were as open as the day, and Dethel
had doubtless ascertained from Reuben the groom
that his master would be from home on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">{522}</span>
particular night; while as for Mr Shillito, everybody
knew how he talked in his loud-voiced
way about his most private affairs when he had
taken more to drink than was good for him.
At the bar of more than one tavern that evening,
every one who might chance to be within hearing
would not fail to be informed that Mr Shillito
had just paid John Waldron his half-year’s
rent.</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through my mind
almost as quickly as that flash which revealed
so much. Breathlessly I waited for the next flash.
It came, shattering the darkness for an instant, and
then it, too, was swallowed up. The men were
no longer visible. Between the two flashes they
had had time to drop on the inner side of the
wall, where the thick clumps of evergreens which
clothed that part of the grounds would effectually
screen them from view. At that very moment
they were doubtless making their way stealthily
towards the house. What was to be done?
Never had I realised so fully as at that moment
how helpless a creature a woman is. Drawing
my shawl more closely round me and putting
on a pair of list slippers which I wore about
the house in cold weather, I crept noiselessly
out of the room. At the top of the stairs I
halted and listened; but all was silence the most
profound. The corridor out of which the bedroom
opened was lighted at the opposite end by
a high narrow window which looked into the
garden. To this window I now made my way,
and there, with one ear pressed to the cold glass,
I stood and listened. Presently I heard the faint
sound of footsteps, and then the subdued voices
of two people talking to each other. Directly
under the place where I was standing was the
back drawing-room, which opened on the garden
by means of a French-window; and although
this window was secured at night by shutters,
I had an idea that the security in question was
more fancied than real, and was of a kind that
would be laughed to scorn by any burglar who
was acquainted with his business. If the men
had made up their minds to break into the house—and
with what other object could they be
there?—the probability was that they would
make the attempt by way of the French-window.
Even while this thought was passing through
my mind, the voices of the men sank to a whisper,
and a low peculiar grating sound made itself
heard. Evidently they had already begun to
force the fastenings of the window. I crept back
to my room, feeling utterly dazed and helpless.</p>

<p>‘Is that you, Barbara? Where have you
been?’ asked my sister.</p>

<p>Going into her room, I sat down on the side
of the bed and told her everything in as few
words as possible. She was of a somewhat timid
and nervous disposition, and my news visibly
affected her. She sat up in bed, trembling and
clinging to my arm.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ she whispered, ‘if we lock our bedroom
doors and keep very quiet, they will go
away without coming near us.’</p>

<p>‘Why, you goose, it’s not us they have come
after, but Mr Shillito’s ninety pounds,’ I
answered.</p>

<p>‘And there’s poor mamma’s silver tea-service
down-stairs; I hope they won’t find that,’ said
Bessie.</p>

<p>I hoped so too; but there was no judging
how much Dethel had contrived to ascertain
respecting us and our affairs. I went to the
corridor window again and listened. The noise
made by the men was now plainly distinguishable.
It seemed as if they were trying to
file or cut their way through some obstruction.
After listening for a few moments, I went back
to my room and began almost mechanically to
put on a few articles of clothing, asking myself
again and again as I did so whether it was
not possible to do something—though what
that something ought to be I knew no more
than the man in the moon. The nearest
house was a quarter of a mile away; and
even if I could have stolen out unnoticed by
way of the front-door, before I could have
reached the farm and brought back help, the
burglars would have effected their purpose and
decamped. Our pecuniary means at that time
were very straitened. For some time back John
had been paying off some old family debts; and
the loss of the ninety pounds—which, as a
matter of course, he would feel bound to make
good—would be a great blow to him. If I could
only have got at the money, and have hidden it
where the burglars would not be likely to find
it, I felt that I should have accomplished something.
But the bag was locked up in John’s
strong mahogany desk, and was as utterly beyond
my reach as if it had been in the coffers of the
Bank of England, while yet it could hardly have
been placed more conveniently ready to the hands
of the thieves. To them the strong mahogany
desk would seem a trifling obstacle indeed.</p>

<p>All this time, metaphorically speaking, I was
wringing my hands, knowing full well how
precious were the fast-fleeting moments, but only
feeling my helplessness the more, the more I
strove to discern some loophole of escape. Oh,
the wretchedness of such a feeling! I hope never
to experience it again in the same degree as I
experienced it that night.</p>

<p>The lightning, if not quite so vivid as it had
been a little while previously, still came in as
frequent flashes, and by its light my sister and
I made a hurried toilet. Our house stood a
little way back from the high-road, from which
it was divided by a tiny lawn and a low screen
of evergreens. Once or twice in the course of
the night one of the mounted constabulary would
ride slowly past as he went his rounds; but I
was without any knowledge as to the particular
time when he might be expected, or whether, in
fact, the time at which he might be looked for
at any specified point did not vary from night
to night. Still, there was just a possibility that
he might put in an appearance at any moment;
so I stationed Bessie at the window to keep a
lookout for him, and be in readiness to raise
an alarm the moment she heard the tramp of
his horse’s hoofs. For once in a way the lightning
was something to be thankful for; each
flash lighted up the high-road for a considerable
distance on both sides of the house.</p>

<p>When this was done, it seemed as if everything
possible had been done; and yet it was next to
nothing. With both hands pressed to my eyes,
I stood thinking as I seemed never to have
thought before. Then it was that—as sudden,
swift, and startling as one of those flashes which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">{523}</span>
were momently illumining the outer world—an
idea shot through my brain, which for an
instant or two seemed to cause my heart to stand
still. And yet at the first blush it was an idea
that had about it something so preposterous, so
ludicrous, even, that had the need been at all
less imminent, I should have discarded it at once
as little better than the inspiration of a mad
woman. But preposterous as the idea might
seem, for the life of me I could think of no other,
and every minute now was invaluable. There
was no time for hesitation. I must discard it
or adopt it, and that without a moment’s delay.
‘I will try it; it can but fail,’ I said to myself
with an inward groan.</p>

<p>On the toilet-table was a jar of white tooth-powder,
which had been replenished the previous
day. I shook out a quantity of this powder,
shut my eyes, and proceeded to rub it thickly
over my face, arms, and hands. That done, I
drew the white coverlet off the bed, and draped
myself with it loosely from head to foot; then I
unbound my hair, which in those days was ebon
black and reached below my waist, and shook
it round my face and over my shoulders in ‘most
admired disorder.’ I was now ready for the
rôle I had made up my mind to enact.</p>

<p>Bessie has told me since that she thought I
had taken leave of my senses. Just at the
moment my toilet was completed, and as I
turned and advanced towards her, another long,
quivering flash lighted up the room. A low
shriek burst involuntarily from my sister’s lips,
and she shrank away from me as though I were
something altogether uncanny.</p>

<p>‘O Barbara, dear, what is the matter?’ she
cried. ‘Why do you frighten me so?’</p>

<p>‘It is not you I want to frighten, but the men
down-stairs,’ I replied. Then, in a few hurried
words, I told her my plan.</p>

<p>She would have tried to dissuade me; but there
was no time to listen. Leaving her there watching
by the window, ready to raise an alarm in
case the mounted constable should pass on his
round, I stole swiftly and noiselessly down the
carpeted staircase, and only paused when I
reached the corridor below. I could hear a
subdued murmur of voices, and a moment later
I was startled by a noise of falling glass. The
burglars had succeeded in effecting an entrance.
They and I were separated only by the drawing-room
door, which, although locked, was an
obstacle that very few minutes would suffice to
overcome. With an indrawing of my breath I
sped quickly past the door along the length of
the corridor until I reached the opposite end,
where there were two more doors, one of them
being that of my brother’s office, which also was
locked, and from the lock of which I now withdrew
the key. I have omitted to state that the
window of John’s office was secured by two stout
bars, which was probably one reason why the
thieves had chosen to effect an entrance at a
point more readily adapted for their purpose.
The second door at the end of the corridor
shut off a short passage leading to the kitchen.
This door I succeeded in opening without noise.
I had decided to take my stand a little way on
the inner side of it, and there await the course
of events. By this time the men were busily
at work forcing the lock of the drawing-room
door. A thin thread of light which shone from
under showed that although the lightning was
still as frequent as before, they did not find it
sufficient for their purpose.</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, I waited. I was too excited,
too wrought up, the tension of my nerves was
too extreme, to allow of any personal fear. It
was all terribly real, yet with a strange, vague
sense of unreality underlying it. I felt as if I
should not have been surprised had I woke up
and found the whole affair resolve itself into a
dream; while yet fully assured in my mind that
it was nothing of the kind. Suddenly the noise
at the door ceased; the lock had been forced.
The thread of light disappeared; for a few moments
all was silence the most profound. Then
a faint creaking, which at any other time would
have been inaudible, told me that the drawing-room
door was being opened and that the crucial
moment had come. I pressed one hand over my
heart, and for a few brief seconds an almost
overpowering longing seized me to get back to
my room at any cost and lock myself within.
But it was too late; by this time the men were
in the corridor. I knew it, although I could not
see them.</p>

<p>‘Where’s the door we want?’ I heard one
whisper to the other.</p>

<p>‘On the right—the first door we come to.’</p>

<p>As they advanced a step, I did the same.</p>

<p>‘What noise was that?’ asked one of them
quickly.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a fool. There was no noise.’</p>

<p>‘I tell you there was.—Where’s the glim?’</p>

<p>But the lightning was quicker than the bull’s-eye.
It came, smiting the darkness, and flooding
the corridor with the blinding intensity of its
glare. Then I saw the men, and the men saw
me, but darkness had hidden us from each
other again before they had time to make sure
that their eyes had not deceived them.</p>

<p>One of them gave a gasp and whispered to his
mate: ‘What was that tall, white thing at the
end of the passage? Seemed to me like a ghost.’</p>

<p>‘Ghost be dashed! There ain’t no such
things.—Here’s the glim. We’ll soon see what
it is.’ As he spoke, the light of his bull’s-eye
lantern was turned full upon me.</p>

<p>I advanced a couple of paces, and the men
fell back in speechless surprise and terror. I
have often tried since to picture to myself the
appearance I must have presented when seen
at such a moment and by that uncertain light,
with my ghastly, death-like face, my dilated
eyes, my black, snake-like locks, my tall figure
all in white, and with one extended arm and
finger pointed direct at the men. I cannot
wonder at their fright.</p>

<p>At this juncture came another flash, and a terrible
peal of thunder startled the air and shook
the house. At the very instant, impelled thereto
by something within me that I was powerless to
control, I burst into a wild peal of maniacal, blood-curdling
laughter. One step nearer I advanced;
but that was enough. With a loud yell of terror,
the men turned and fled by the way they had
come. I heard a crash of shattered glass; and
after that, I remember nothing more till I
came to my senses, to find Bessie supporting my
head on her lap and pressing her smelling-salts
to my nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">{524}</span></p>

<p>But John’s ninety pounds were saved, and
it is hardly necessary to add that Dethel the
ex-gardener was never seen in those parts
again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SPIDER-SILK">SPIDER-SILK.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may not be inopportune to recall to the
minds of our readers a somewhat neglected silk-source,
which may perhaps at some future period
form a profitable commercial undertaking. It is
unnecessary to expatiate upon the beauty of the
gossamer spun by the <i>Aranea diadema</i>, or common
Garden spider, as the fairy-like tracery must be
familiar to every one who has wandered through
the woods in autumn, when the gauzy films
festooned between and over the bushes were
rendered prominent through saturation with dew
or a sprinkling of hoar-frost. The thread produced
by this little creature is estimated to be
many times finer than the most attenuated filament
of the well-known silkworm of Europe, the
<i>Bombyx mori</i>; consequently, as may be imagined,
the difficulty of obtaining such silk is so great
that, except for land-surveying purposes, the
web of spiders as a class has not been permanently
utilised. For the latter object, the plan
adopted by our surveying instrument makers<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
in order to secure small supplies of spider’s
line, is remarkably simple, and affords an illustration
of how closely instinct in the lower
creation sometimes approaches reasoning intelligence
in the higher. Having caught the selected
spider, it is immediately tossed backwards and
forwards from hand to hand of the operator,
until the impulse of self-preservation induces the
emission of its thread. Meanwhile, a wire, bent
double like a hairpin—the distance between
the prongs being slightly greater than the diameter
of the telescope to be fitted—is at hand to
receive the silk. As soon as the filament appears,
the end is attached to the wire and the spider
dropped, when it immediately emits its thread
with great rapidity, in the hope of reaching the
ground and escaping. This is frustrated by a
dexterous revolution of the extemporised reel,
which winds up the line as fast as it is produced,
until the spider’s store of silk is exhausted.
It is then allowed its liberty; and a touch of
gum on each prong secures the silk in convenient
lengths for future use.</p>

<p>Rather more than fifty years ago, it seemed as
if a new and important trade was about to be
inaugurated by the rearing of spiders for their
silk, which the Society of Arts marked with their
approval by awarding a medal to a Mr Rolt
for his success in obtaining an appreciable quantity
from the Garden spider. This gentleman
accomplished his purpose by connecting a reel
with a steam-engine, setting it revolving at the
rate of one hundred and fifty feet per minute;
when, after two hours’ patience, he wound off
eighteen thousand feet of beautiful white line of
a metallic lustre from twenty-four spiders. Subsequent
examination proved this thread to be
only the thirty-thousandth part of an inch in
diameter, so that a single pound-weight was
estimated to be sufficient to encircle the globe.
Although this gentleman appears not to have
pushed his interesting experiments much further,
a Frenchman of Languedoc afterwards established
a factory for producing and weaving
spider-silk into articles of utility. He manufactured
gloves and stockings which were much
admired; but the difficulty of rearing a sufficiently
numerous family of spinners within a
reasonable space, on account of their extreme
pugnacity, soon interfered with this budding
industry, and led to its abandonment. No
difficulty was experienced by M. Reaumur in collecting
some five thousand spiders and immuring
them in fifty separate cells; but unfortunately,
on one occasion there occurred a scarcity of
flies; a food-panic ensued, and the hungry and
infuriated prisoners, escaping during the night,
fell upon one another with such deadly ferocity,
that when the anxious proprietor paid his
usual morning visit, only a few gorged and
bloated specimens survived. It seemed, indeed,
so vain to expect European spiders to exist
peacefully within sight and reach of each other
without their usual employment conducted after
their own fashion, that the hope of rendering
them useful for commercial purposes gradually
died away, and has for many years been almost
wholly relinquished.</p>

<p>Certain species of foreign spiders, however,
when examined with a view to their silk, offer a
field of very considerable encouragement. In
the island of Ceylon there is one described by
Sir Samuel Baker as being two inches long, with
a large yellow spot upon its back, which spins a
beautiful yellow web two and a half feet in
diameter, so strong that an ordinary walking-stick
thrown in is entangled, and retained among the
meshes. As might be expected, the filament,
which is said to exhibit a more silky appearance
than common spider’s web, is easily wound by
hand on a card, without any special care being
exercised in the operation. A spider of even
more formidable dimensions is alluded to in the
fascinating work, <i>The Gardens of the Sun</i>, by Mr
F. W. Burbidge. It is a large, black, yellow-spotted
creature, measuring six or eight inches
across its extended legs, and it spins a web
strained on lines as stout as fine sewing-cotton.</p>

<p>The prince of the species, however, seems to be
the <i>Aranea maculata</i> of Brazil, vouched for by
Dr Walsh as having been seen and examined by
him during his travels in that country. In this
huge, ungainly, yet harmless and domesticated
creature, we evidently possess a treasure of a silk-spinner,
with which the non-nervous and practical
among our colonial ladies, situated in moderately
warm localities like Northern New Zealand,
Queensland, and the Cape of Good Hope, might
spend many a profitable hour when they became
mutually acquainted. It is not only free from
the vices of the European spider in not devouring
its kind, but it actually exists in little harmonious
communities of over one hundred individuals of
different ages and sizes occupying the same web.
Like the last-mentioned spider, this one is of
similar colossal dimensions, and it spins a beautiful
yellow network ten or twelve feet in diameter
quite as strong as the silk of commerce. Regarding
the toughness of this filament, the doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">{525}</span>
says: ‘In passing through an opening between
some trees, I felt my head entangled in some
obstruction, and on withdrawing it, my light
straw-hat remained behind. When I looked up,
I saw it suspended in the air, entangled in the
meshes of an immense cobweb, which was drawn
like a veil of thick gauze across the opening, and
was expanded from branch to branch of the
opposite trees as large as a sheet, ten or twelve
feet in diameter.’ Another traveller, Lieutenant
Herndon of the United States navy, confirms Dr
Walsh’s account of this enormous spider, with
the addition that he saw a single web which
nearly covered a lemon tree; and he estimated its
diameter at ten yards!</p>

<p>Probably the latest addition to our knowledge
of spider-silk has recently come from the
Paris ‘Ecole pratique d’Acclimation,’ a member
of which has discovered an African species which
spins a strong yellow web, so like the product of
the silkworm as to be scarcely distinguishable
from it. So promising a material as a fibre of
commerce does this seem to be, that, after close
investigation, a syndicate of Lyons silk-merchants
has reported in its favour; the more so as there
is said to be no difficulty in acclimatising the
spider in France.</p>

<p>In those gigantic spiders there is evidently the
nucleus of an important industry of the future,
which colonists might perhaps easily ingraft upon
their ordinary sericultural or other occupations.
If the period has scarcely yet arrived for the
profitable utilisation of ordinary spider’s web,
surely something might be evolved from the less
attenuated filaments just alluded to, which are
strong enough to whisk a man’s hat from his
head and retain his walking-stick dangling in the
air. There are countless difficulties to be surmounted,
such as the feeling of repulsion, or
even disgust, at being brought into proximity
with monstrous spiders like Dr Walsh’s pets; but
as this species, unlike the <i>Lycosa tarantula</i> and
other poisonous and dreaded kinds, is harmless to
human beings, and as their silk would evidently
become a valuable addition to the resources of
the loom as well as the boudoir, any such feelings
and other obstacles would probably soon be
overcome. The French—always in the van in
such matters, notwithstanding their comparatively
limited colonial opportunities—are not likely to
allow this curious and interesting occupation to
go begging for want of experiment and patience.
But Britain—with her numerous dependencies
and myriads of active, scheming, inventive brains
scattered all over the globe—occupies a peculiarly
favourable position to test and localise
such an industry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THIEVES_AND_THIEVING">THIEVES AND THIEVING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days when Border moss-troopers made a
raid on the well-stocked farmyards of Northumberland,
or when Highland caterans swooped
down from Rob Roy’s country to levy ‘blackmail’
or ‘toom a fauld’ in the Lennox or in the Carse
of Stirling, and departed, leaving burning byres
or weeping widows behind, are for ever gone.
Gone, too, are those later days when bold highwaymen
of the Dick Turpin type—all well
mounted and equipped, if we are to credit the
legends that have come down to us—stopped
the mailcoach or the travelling postchaise, and
made the terrified passengers hand over their
valuables. The traveller of to-day, whether
cyclist or pedestrian, may roam from John o’
Groat’s to Land’s End without interruption from
highwayman or footpad. The thieving profession
has changed its character; and as now
unfolded in courts of justice, it appears vulgar,
prosaic, and mean. Indeed, we are doubtful if
it was not always so. The pen of the novelist
has thrown a glamour of romance around that
as well as other features of former times, which
we love to read about, but should not care to
experience. But while this is so, the study of
thieves as a class is far from being uninteresting.
It has been our lot to see much of them and
to learn more, from sources whose reliability is
unquestionable.</p>

<p>There are many grades of intellect and ability
among these Ishmaelites—from the low type of
thief that lies in wait in our large towns for
children going messages, and, beguiling them into
a dark close, strips them of clothing and money—to
the well-dressed, well-bred man of the world,
who floats a swindling Company, has his office in
a good locality, moves for a time in the best
circles, and then decamps, carrying with him
the capital of the elderly annuitant, or the hard-earned
savings of the struggling tradesman. To
her shame be it said, the child-stripper is generally
a woman. Far more to his shame, the
high-class swindler is generally a well-educated
man, who occupies a good position in society,
and has often only his own folly to blame
for his having fallen to be a needy adventurer.
They differ in degree, but not in kind; and
though the law may call their offences by different
names, the essence of the crime is the
same in both cases.</p>

<p>It is sad to see mere children, charged with
daring acts of pocket-picking or purse-snatching,
brought before a court; but such is often their
only chance of salvation from a life of crime.
Smutty-faced, ragged little urchins many of them
are, dressed in clothes and shoes a world too
big for them; and yet, when the dirt is washed
from their faces, there is the glance of keen
intelligence, and often comely features, underneath.
Brought up in the murky closes that
yet occupy the older parts of most of our cities,
surrounded by influences such as may be inhaled
from drunken, swearing men, and tawdry, coarse,
and unkempt women, how could they grow up
other than they do? Perchance they are reared
in low lodging-houses, where a clever theft or
an artful dodge is extolled as worthy of the
highest admiration, or where some old hand is
assiduous in giving them training lessons in
crime. Industrial and Reformatory Schools are
worthy of all support, checking as they do the
career of these young prodigals while yet there is
some hope. Apart altogether from considerations
of a higher nature, it is surely to the interest of
the public that children should be trained into
useful wealth-producing members of the community,
instead of growing up to prey upon
society when out of prison, and burden the ratepayers
when in.</p>

<p>A large number of thieves are merely skirmishers
or auxiliaries, as it were, on the flanks
of the regular army. These auxiliaries do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">{526}</span>
live wholly by crime, but have some ostensible
occupation which they follow. At the same time,
they never lose a good opportunity of stealing.
In all large towns, the cinder-gatherer may be
seen. Late at night and early in the morning
she goes through the streets and lanes, probing
with a long knife the depths and shallows of
every dust-heap, and rescuing therefrom every
scrap that will sell. Papers, rags, bones, cinders,
and old boots are transferred with marvellous
celerity into the depths of the capacious bag
which she carries. Should a stray door-mat be
lying handy, or an unsecured back-door give
access to a green where clothes lie bleaching,
her ideas of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> become straightway
rather hazy, and the chances are that a theft is
reported next morning. A large number of thefts
of umbrellas and greatcoats from lobbies are the
work of pedlars, beggars, or old-clothesmen, who
loaf around and watch their chance. A smart
‘professional’ of our acquaintance, who is at
present in penal servitude, was an adept at
stealing greatcoats. He had a piece of wire with
a sort of hook on one end, with which he could
snatch them from lobby-pegs without making
his own appearance. Each ‘professional’ has his
own particular style of thieving in which he has
graduated. These soon become known to the
detectives, who, on learning the <i>modus operandi</i>
of a theft, are often able to pounce on the
person wanted, even when no description can be
supplied.</p>

<p>One class of theft was very prevalent in
Glasgow and neighbourhood some time ago. A
man dressed like a tradesman called at a number
of houses where the owners happened to be absent.
(Of course the operator satisfied himself on that
point first.) He represented that he had been
sent by some well-known firm of upholsterers to
measure a room for a new carpet, or by a joiner
to repair the windows. In various instances,
he got into houses, and generally found an opportunity
to steal. Another thief well known in
Dundee does the ‘pigeon’ trick. His method
is to look out for an open window, ring the
bell, and say that a pigeon has just flown away
from him on the street and fluttered in at the
window. Would they kindly search for it, or
permit him to do so? Once in, ten to one but
the clever thief manages to commit a theft before
he goes out lamenting the loss of his bird, which,
of course, cannot be found.</p>

<p>A decrepit youth used to go about the city
in which the writer lives. This lad’s legs were
useless, so he had flat boards fastened with straps
below his knees, and, assisted by short crutches,
he crept along the pavement. He was a dexterous
thief. If a lady stopped to look in at a shop-window,
he could just reach her handbag or
pocket; and if she was unwary, she was minus
her purse in a few seconds, while the insignificant
appearance of the thief disarmed suspicion.</p>

<p>Thieves sometimes quarrel in their cups, and
if a detective happens to meet them before the
heat of anger has passed off, spitefulness often
induces them to give him valuable information.
Criminals are almost always prodigal in spending
their ill-gotten gains, and the old proverb, ‘Lightly
come, lightly go,’ seems specially applicable to
them. If in funds, they share freely with their
needy brethren, probably with an eye to receiving
similar help when out at the knees and elbows
themselves.</p>

<p>Stolen property is often stowed away in very
curious hiding-places. A lame man was convicted
at Leeds assizes last year of passing base
coin. When apprehended, it was found he had
a receptacle in his wooden leg, in which a considerable
stock of the bad money was cunningly
secreted. We have sometimes seen a considerable
pile of coins unearthed from the voluminous
folds of a ragged coat, trousers, or vest. Banknotes,
for obvious reasons, are capable of being
stowed away in little space; and thieves often
hide them in the cracked joints of a dilapidated
old table, chair, or bed. Underneath a picture,
or between the portrait and the back, appears
to be a favourite place of concealment. Articles
are often ‘planked’ in the chimney behind the
grate; and a watch has even been tossed into a
glowing coal-fire, when pursuit was close, although
in at least one instance the latter device was
unavailing. Two detectives were once searching
the house of a well-known thief for some stolen
jewellery. The scent was keen, and the examination
searching. High and low they rummaged,
but without success. From the air of the thief,
the officers were satisfied the stolen property was
concealed in or about the room. One of them
observed that the interest of the ‘suspect’ got
always most intense as they approached the
window. Taking this as his cue, the officer
narrowly examined the shutters, and even tore
off the straps that kept in the window-sashes;
but without result. Suddenly, a thought struck
him, and lifting the lower sash, he scanned
the outside of the wall closely. About three or
four feet below the window-sill he saw a stone
in the wall that appeared to be loose. Calling
his comrade to hold him by the legs, he reached
down, pulled out a small square stone, thrust
in his hand, and found a nice little ‘hide,’ containing
not only the articles he was in search of,
but also other stolen property sufficient to connect
the thief with several ‘jobs,’ and to procure
him a long term of quiet contemplation.</p>

<p>A smart female thief once very nearly outwitted
an officer by wrapping a crumpled and
dirty five-pound note round a candle, and stuffing
it into a candlestick, which she then obligingly
handed to him. He searched a considerable time
before discovering that he had the object of his
search in his hand. Another detective, after in
vain searching a house for some trussed poultry
that had been stolen, cast one parting glance
around, when his eye chanced to alight on a
cradle in which a woman was vainly trying to
hush a squalling baby. A thought struck him.
He asked her to lift the child. The woman
made some excuse, but the officer insisted, and
was immediately rewarded by finding a couple
of the stolen fowls.</p>

<p>A slight clue, sometimes discovered by the
merest accident, often helps to unravel not only
one, but a whole series of thefts. A peculiar
button, a footmark, or a portion of dress, will
spring a mine under the feet of a rascal who
thought he was off scot-free. Of late years, thefts
of money by young clerks or salesmen from their
employers have become increasingly common.
There are several causes for this. Beyond doubt
the tastes and habits of the young men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">{527}</span>
to-day are more expensive than those of their
fathers. With small means, or no means at all,
they dress up as ‘mashers,’ and smoke choice
cigars, attend theatres, concerts, balls, and race-meetings.
If often indulged in, these are rather
expensive luxuries; and as the supply of youths
anxious for genteel employment is always in
excess of the demand, the salaries given are in
many cases low. Then firms are sometimes very
lax in the oversight of young men who have
large sums of money daily passing through their
hands. It seems so easy to take the loan of a
small sum, which, of course, is to be put back
again. After the first false step, the descent is
rapid; and many a young man fills a felon’s
cell, or has to fly the country, under circumstances
due to his master’s carelessness as well as
his own folly.</p>

<p>The plea of kleptomania is now put forward
in defence of thieves much oftener than it used
to be. Of course there are some cases in which
kleptomania is indisputable, as, for instance, when
we hear of a nobleman having to be watched by
his valet to prevent him from pocketing his own
silver spoons. We know a respectable bookseller
who had for a considerable time, at intervals,
been missing books from his shop. He was satisfied
some of his customers were helping themselves,
but he could not say which. At last his
suspicions rested on a reverend gentleman of great
abilities, but rather eccentric character. He
watched him narrowly, and one day caught him
in the act of surreptitiously carrying off a volume.
The divine tried to explain it away; but the
bookseller, after listening gravely, called a cab,
and insisted on accompanying him home and
examining his library. He hinted that otherwise
he would be under the painful necessity of calling
in the police. The clergyman made no further
objection. They went to his house; and the
bookseller brought back a number of valuable
books, some of which he had not before missed,
and said no more about the matter. The thief
was a wealthy man, and had a large library; but
he was a bibliomaniac.</p>

<p>Some thefts, however, are of a different character,
and in these the plea of kleptomania, like
that of insanity in cases of murder, is sometimes
pushed rather far. Without attempting to argue
the matter on scientific principles, it seems rather
strange that kleptomania appears only to affect
those who are rich enough to pay an able advocate,
and that the morbid desire to steal something—instead
of moving them to carry it off
openly—appears to be accompanied by an equally
morbid desire to secrete the article stolen.</p>

<p>We shall conclude this paper by one or two
instances which show that thieving has also its
comic side.</p>

<p>A fire was raging fiercely in a grocery store,
and the owner, accompanied by an active staff of
assistants, was trying to rescue some of the goods
by removing them to one side. Immense cheeses
and hams were lying about in tempting profusion.
A keen-eyed thief had just secured a
large Gouda, and was marching off with it, when
he found himself face to face with a policeman.
The rogue grasped the situation instantly. ‘Here,
policeman!’ cried he, planting the cheese in X’s
arms before that officer knew what he was about;
‘you had better take charge of that, or somebody’ll
be carrying it off;’ and in an instant the nimble
rascal disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p>One morning, a merchant who had come by
rail from his country residence was hurrying
along the street to his counting-house in a pouring
rain. He had forgotten his umbrella; but
spying, as he thought, a friend with a large one
a little before him, he hastened up, and seizing
the handle of the umbrella, jocularly observed:
‘Hillo! is this mine you’ve got?’ He had just
had time to observe that the man was a complete
stranger to him, and was about to apologise in
some embarrassment, when the unknown saved
him the trouble, by saying coolly: ‘Oh, it’s
yours, is it? Pardon me; I did not know.’ And
he hurried off, leaving the astonished merchant
in full possession.</p>

<p>About two years ago, a constable in a business
part of London found a horse and van, about
midnight, standing at the door of a grocer’s shop.
He approached, and saw several men in aprons,
apparently carrying chests of tea into the shop.
Remarking that they were late at work, one
of the men replied: ‘O yes; we’re preparing
for Christmas;’ and the constable, thinking all
was right, walked on. Next morning it was
found the shop had been entered by thieves,
who had carried off what they evidently took
to be twenty-two half-chests of tea, most of
which had been standing in the shop-window.
The rogues had gone leisurely to work, and
being caught by the constable, had employed
themselves in carrying <i>in</i> some of the boxes, till
he should pass. The reader may judge the
surprise and disgust of the thieves, when they
found that only one of the chests contained tea,
and a second tea-dust, the remaining twenty boxes
being merely ‘dummies’ filled with sawdust, with
a sprinkling of tea on the top!</p>

<p>Nothing tends more to root out and lessen
the number of nests of thieves than the exercise
of the power vested in corporations to pull down
old houses, which, densely populated with the
poorer classes, become at last the abodes of filth,
disease, and crime. The former inmates cannot
stand the new sanitary and social atmosphere
introduced by wider streets and purer air. They
gradually betake themselves to other and more
honest modes of employment, or seek for ‘fresh
woods and pastures new.’ On the other hand, the
exercise of a little prudence and common-sense
by the general public would prevent an opportunity
being given for the commission of a large
number of petty but often very annoying thefts.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ST_JOHNS_GATE">ST JOHN’S GATE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A short</span> distance from the very heart of London,
stands—for it has not yet been swept away by
the builder’s hand—one of the finest remaining
relics of the ancient city. It is a heavy fortified
gate, built of large blocks of freestone, and flanked
by bastions. It has a fine groined Norman arch;
and though it is now old and decayed, it is still
strong, and shows us what its strength and
stability have been in days gone by. It was
built by, and belonged to, at one time, that famous
order of chivalry, ‘The Knights Hospitallers,’ or
‘Knights of St John of Jerusalem,’ the great rivals
of the Templars, and who did such good service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">{528}</span>
in the Holy Land in the time of the crusades;
and when Palestine was hopelessly lost, kept up
their incessant war against the Infidel in Rhodes,
and when driven from that island by the Turks—in
Malta.</p>

<p>This order had at one time many religious
houses scattered over Europe; and their London
priory, that of St John of Clerkenwell, has quite
a history of its own to tell. It was founded in
the year 1100 by a devout baron named Jordan
Briset, this being the time that the first crusade,
led by Godfrey of Bouillon, was going on. For
a considerable time after this, we know little of
the priory, save that the knights were growing
in riches and arrogance, and thus were making
themselves obnoxious to the people, although
some of the old chroniclers tell us that ‘they
tended the sick and the needy.’ In fact, they
got to be so disliked by the common people, that
in the riots which took place in the reign of
Richard II.—in which Wat Tyler, Jack Straw,
and John Ball took so prominent a part, the last-named
being a clergyman, who, in his harangues
to the multitude, took for his text the rhyme,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Adam delved and Eve span,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was then a gentleman?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and made the people think that all the property
of the rich was really theirs—the rebels made the
Priory of St John a special mark of their fury,
and after destroying houses and much property
belonging to the knights, they attacked the place
itself and burnt it to the ground; and capturing
the prior soon after, they executed him upon
the spot.</p>

<p>For many years after, the knights were engaged
in building a new priory; but the work went
slowly on, owing to the troubled state of the
order at what was then their great stronghold,
Rhodes, and the large numbers of men and sums
of money required there to assist in keeping back
the conquering Turks, who were fighting with
great zeal under the victorious Sultan Solyman.
Gradually, a fine church, whose bell is related
to have had an exceedingly fine tone, was added
to the priory; and soon after the church was
finished, Thomas Dockwra, who was then prior,
built the gate; this being in or about the year
1504, in the latter part of the reign of Henry
VII., the first of the famous dynasty of Tudor
sovereigns.</p>

<p>About the year 1540, Henry VIII. suppressed
all the larger monasteries and private religious
houses in England, and the venerable priory fell
with the others. This was a severe blow to the
prosperity of the order, and is said to have broken
the heart of the valiant old L’isle Adam, the
grandmaster, who held Rhodes till he could hold
it no longer, and then, obtaining honourable terms
from the Sultan Solyman, removed to the island
of Malta, where the knights continued to be a
powerful enemy to the Turks until 1798, when,
‘through the treachery of the Maltese, and the
cowardice of D’Hompesch the grandmaster, the
island was surrendered to the French;’ and soon
after this, most of the property still belonging
to the order in many parts of Europe was confiscated
by the various governments. Since then,
the order, which had been gradually degenerating,
has not had any political importance.</p>

<p>The priory, however, was not destroyed, like
most of its kindred buildings, at the Reformation,
for even the bluff, matter-of-fact King Henry had
some respect for the venerable old building; and
so, instead of destroying it, we are told that he
used it for a military storehouse. In Edward
VI.’s reign, however, a more ruthless and sweeping
hand came to deal with it. The proud and
ambitious Seymour, Duke of Somerset, at that
time Lord Protector, had no kindly feeling for
such places; and the church and all the rest of
the priory, with the exception of the gate, were
blown up with gunpowder. The large blocks of
stone were used to build Somerset’s palace in the
Strand in 1549. It remained till the year 1776,
when it gave place to the present one, a building
erected after the Palladian style, from the designs
of Sir William Chambers.</p>

<p>We hear nothing more of the gate till the reign
of James I., when that monarch bestowed the
building on Sir Roger Wilbraham, who lived
there for many years. Long after this, Cave the
printer rented the old gate for a small sum, and
here was first printed and published the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>. This was one of the first places
to which Dr Johnson, then poor, and almost
unknown, came, when he settled in the great city.
Here he made his first literary efforts by helping
Cave in his publication. Here also Garrick the
actor first played, some of Cave’s interested workmen
taking the other parts of the pieces.</p>

<p>The old gate is now turned into a tavern, called
<i>Old Jerusalem Tavern</i>, and inside may still be seen
some interesting relics of the former days of the
gate, when it was the chief entrance to the priory
of one of the most powerful religious bodies in
Europe. Who can look upon such a relic without
being reminded of the great spirit of chivalry,
that strange compound of barbarity and courtesy;
of the crusades, and the great changes which have
taken place since the time of the prosperous days
of the old priory? and we cannot but feel thankful
that we live in a happier, less troubled, and more
enlightened age; and as we gaze upon the grim old
gate, think of the words of Shakspeare: ‘To what
base uses may we return.’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
